## Project Description

10xCards empowers users to quickly create flashcards from arbitrary text (500â€“15,000 characters) via a large language model (LLM) API. Users can batch-generate up to 10 cards in JSON format, manually create, edit, or delete cards, and schedule reviews using an open-source SRS algorithm. The application also handles user authentication, GDPR compliance, and basic telemetry for AI-generated card acceptance.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Astro 5, React 19, TypeScript 5  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4, Shadcn/ui  
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth)  
- **AI Integration:** Openrouter.ai (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models)  
- **CI/CD & Hosting:** GitHub Actions, Docker, DigitalOcean
